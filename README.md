# CS 524: Introduction to Optimization
This directory contains solutions I wrote for assignments for a class, CS 524: Introduction to Optimization, 
at University of Wisconsin-Madison. Each homework consists of multiple optimization problems whose solutions
are implemented as models written in Julia using JuMP. The solutions are contained in Julia notebooks, but
the code within those notebooks, their output and accompanying explanation of solutions can be viewed
in the PDF file in each homework directory.
